# LangChain Tutorials

Now that LLMs are capable of question-answering and following instructions, we can do many things with them:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation: We can upload a body of text(eg. a textbook) and ask the LLM questions based on that file
- Create Autonomous agents, that are capable of browsing the web

This repo will contain some tutorials on LangChain, with mini-projects included in them.
